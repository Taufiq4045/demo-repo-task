=>List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs. :-
1)Browser JS has a DOM(document object model) where as nodejs doesn't have a DOM.
2)The major difference between both environments is that one is subject to rigorous security policies and restrictions (browser) while the other isin't. 
The browser is also an untrustable environment for security-related operations such as enforcing security permissions.
3)Node.js has built-in libraries for HTTP and socket communication with which it can create a web server and thus be a replacement
 for other types of servers such as. Apache or Nginx
4)Node.js does not have browser APIs related to DOM, CSS, performance, document, as well as all APIs associated with the "window" object.
 Precisely because of the lack of a window object, the global object was renamed "global".
6)Since the development of JavaScript is moving very fast, browsers often lag behind the implementation of new features of JavaScript,
 so you need to use an older version of JavaScript in the Browser, but this does not apply to Node.js,
 you can use it all modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript if your version of Node.js supports it.
